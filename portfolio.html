            <p>With my current position at Aetna/CVS I have learned many new things concerning data management. While I have been an employee, I created 8 different databases for different projects. I was given the task, conducted the research and built user friendly databaseâ€™s in order to save time and money. 
                I was given many challenges to overcome, from being CAP Team leader, resolving employee issues and facilitating communications, to document and software management.  
                The CAP (Change Acceleration Process) team was created to bring about a new direction to the project due to new ownership.  As CAP Team Leader I was in charge of scheduling all meetings and presiding over each one.  The team was comprised of roughly 20 people from all departments.  We developed strategies to ensure that all goals were clear and attainable, and that each of the 150 employees supported the success of the campaign.  
                Additionally, I have worked with approximately a hundred different contractors during our startup and expansion phases.  CS Mining purchased project management software, and I was chosen to become the expert.  I communicated with and trained the various contractors how to use the online based software.  At times this was quite challenging because everyone, including CS employees, was very used to using their own preferred email programs, and were resistant to using the required project management software.   The program did have a help line, but most people would call me to get the answers they needed.  One gentleman even asked me why he should call them when I could work the issue in less than half the time.  All of the contractors knew me and were more than willing to work with me on anything I needed.  I gained long lasting relationships with most of them. 
                In each and every department I solved employee issues, organized meetings and events, fixed technical issues, developed plans and procedures, designed excel documents, and produced flow charts.
